Sometimes you may want to hide the rule differences between different groups, if that is the case enable private_rules.

This setting affects only <highlight><symbol>rules<end> and <highlight><symbol>rules changes<end> when they are used in private channel or org channel.

If enabled, these commands will just respond with a link, to force people use it as private message (/tell) and only if the command is given as private message the real rule contents shows up.

If disabled, these commands will show the real rule contents directly and everyone can see them.
